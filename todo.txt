General Idea:
Blockchain spotify
    - store hashes of music files in a smart contract
    - ensure that users must tip artists before getting data for a song
    - have an offchain service for allowing an artist to create a new account 
        - with each new account a new contract is deployed to the network with all of the artists songs and funds
    - just a hobby project so security will not be strict

architecture:
    - multiple individual services (probably microservices pattern)
        - blockchain service
            - contains contracts 
        - user managemnet service
            - maintains user accounts
            - deploys new contracts
        - authenticaiton service
        - frontend/UI
            - web app written in react and typescript
