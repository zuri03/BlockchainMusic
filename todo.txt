General Idea:
Blockchain spotify
    - store hashes of music files in a smart contract
    - ensure that users must tip artists before getting data for a song
    - have an offchain service for allowing an artist to create a new account 
        - with each new account a new contract is deployed to the network with all of the artists songs and funds

architecture:
    - multiple individual services (probably microservices pattern)
        - blockchain service
            - contains contracts 
        - authentication service:
            This service will only store metadata about users to allow for authentication
        - api gateway:
            only service the user's browser can call directly
            serves as a proxy/filter for the other services 
                needs to be highly secure and performant
            keeps track of session
        - music service:
            - rest api that manages metadata about songs
        - static file server:
            - serves HTML, CSS and JS files to the user
todo:
    implement nodejs security practices:

    music-service:
        add pagination
        mock external db for tests  
        add a input handling/cleaning library
        add song-cover routes (add external db first)

    static file server: 
        improve the look of each page and the site theme
        finish web pages:
            user page:
                create user signup form

            browse music page:
                set up donwload function for each song
            
            song page:
                improve the look of the song form
    
    user/authentication service:
        set up skeleton of user service:
        
    API Gateway:
        set up skeleton of gateway

    blockchain service:
        set up contract to hold songs by a single artists
        set up skeleton of offchain part of this service
        add tests to blockchain-service
        create dockerfile for offchain part of blockchain service
