General Idea:
Blockchain spotify
    - store hashes of music files in a smart contract
    - ensure that users must tip artists before getting data for a song
    - have an offchain service for allowing an artist to create a new account 
        - with each new account a new contract is deployed to the network with all of the artists songs and funds
    - just a hobby project so security will not be strict

architecture:
    - multiple individual services (probably microservices pattern)
        - blockchain service
            - contains contracts 
        - user managemnet service
            - maintains user accounts
            - deploys new contracts
        - authenticaiton service
        - frontend/UI
            - web app written in react and typescript

todo:
    determine whether to use react or static file sever
    
    static file server: 
        finish web pages:
            user page:
                create user signup form
                set up signed in user page
                looking into using redux and JWT to handle login and state
            browse music page:
                set up search bar 
                set up a grid of music that is available for download
            music page:
                set up page display details about a single snippet of music
        create front end javascript files:
            user.js:
                need a way to keep a user signed in after they sign in
            music.js:
            browse.js:
    
    user service:
        set up skeleton of user service:

    music service:
        uncaught errors causes express to return html file with 500 error 
    
    blockchain service:
        set up contract to hold snippts by a single artists
        set up skeleton of offchain part of this service
        add tests to blockchain-service
        create dockerfile for offchain part of blockchain service
    
    create docker-compose file to deploy entire system
