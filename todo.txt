General Idea:
Blockchain spotify
    - store hashes of music files in a smart contract
    - ensure that users must tip artists before getting data for a song
    - have an offchain service for allowing an artist to create a new account 
        - with each new account a new contract is deployed to the network with all of the artists songs and funds

architecture:
    - multiple individual services (probably microservices pattern)
        - blockchain service
            - contains contracts 
        - authentication service:
            This service will only store metadata about users to allow for authentication
        - api gateway:
            only service the user's browser can call directly
            serves as a proxy/filter for the other services 
                needs to be highly secure and performant
            keeps track of session
        - music service:
            - rest api that manages metadata about songs
        - static file server:
            - serves HTML, CSS and JS files to the user
todo:
    setup and configure s3 bucket

    implement nodejs security practices:
        https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html

    music-service:
        increase security of mongo instance
        add pagination
        mock external db for tests
        finish adding tests for all routes  
        add a input handling/cleaning library
        imporve security of docker container
        properly configure CORS
        storing covers:
            set up covers route to allow users to upload images (add a hard limit to image size for security)
            return URL or ideally just image id back to client and store it in input field
            submit the rest of the data including the image URL to the song routes as a json

    static file server: 
        improve the look of each page and the site theme
        finish web pages:
            user page:
                create user signup form

            browse music page:
                set up donwload function for each song (depends on blochain service)
            
            song page:
                improve the look of the song form
                add function to load data for a song
                add funciton to download song (depends on blochain service)
    
    user/authentication service:
        set up skeleton of user service:
        
    API Gateway:
        set up skeleton of gateway

    blockchain service:
        set up contract to hold songs by a single artists
        set up skeleton of offchain part of this service
        add tests to blockchain-service
        create dockerfile for offchain part of blockchain service
