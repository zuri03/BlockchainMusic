General Idea:
Blockchain spotify
    - store hashes of music files in a smart contract
    - ensure that users must tip artists before getting data for a song
    - have an offchain service for allowing an artist to create a new account 
        - with each new account a new contract is deployed to the network with all of the artists songs and funds

architecture:
    - multiple individual services (probably microservices pattern)
        - blockchain service
            - contains contracts 
        - user managemnet service
            - maintains user accounts
            - deploys new contracts
        - authenticaiton service
        - frontend/UI
            - static file server to server html files
todo:
    setup docker-compose 

    music-service:
        add external db 
        add a input handling/cleaning library
        add song-cover routes (add external db first)

    static file server: 
        improve the look of each page and the site theme
        finish web pages:
            user page:
                create user signup form
                set up signed in user page
                looking into using redux and JWT to handle login and state
            browse music page:
                set up donwload function for each song
            
            song page:
                improve the look of the song form
    
    user service:
        set up skeleton of user service:
    
    blockchain service:
        set up contract to hold snippts by a single artists
        set up skeleton of offchain part of this service
        add tests to blockchain-service
        create dockerfile for offchain part of blockchain service
